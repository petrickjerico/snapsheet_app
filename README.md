## Calculator
*If the scanner feels a bit too much, the calculator is a comfier alternative!* <br>
Have calculations on the spot and manually add expenses. <br>
Also, the calculator is sentient enough to not make records out of "edge" values (like 0 or Infinity). <br>  <br>

## Statistics
*Yes, it's hard to make sense out of all text but no visualisation...<br>*
Statistics here visualises a summary of users' expenses in each accounts. <br>
What Statistics is all about:
- Balance: shows income, spending and the net cashflow of the user. <br>
- Expenses breakdown: shows the total spending for each category. <br>
- Amount trend: shows the total amount at a given time of the account. <br>  <br>

## Scanner
*It's called SNAPsheet for a reason. Ha! <br>*
Our scanner is meticulously equipped with an original parser! <br>
It takes an image of a receipt (gallery or camera) and automatically make a sensible record out of it for you. <br>
What it detects:
- (Singapore) shop names
- Total cost
- Date
- Category of the shop

## Bulk-Scan Receipts
*Need to scan a lot? We've got you covered!* <br>
Scan multiple receipt images form the gallery and extract each data all at once.  <br>
Review and fix the captured data before all the receipts land to any account. <br>
If a record has a receipt image in the cloud, a quick-access receipt icon lets you view the image directly. <br>  <br>

## Export
*Maybe you're an accountant? A treasurer?* <br>
Export expenses in CSV format if you need to share your expenses details to others. <br>  <br>
